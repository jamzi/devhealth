> Habits are routine behaviors done regularly. They are recurrent and often unconscious patterns of behavior and are acquired through frequent repetition. Many of these are unconscious as we donâ€™t even realize we are doing them (MakeOrBreakHabits.com).

In a great book called [The Power of Habit](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X), Charles Duhigg tells us that
about 45% of the decisions we made in our daily lives are habits.

To excel at forming habits, you need to train your **willpower**, which is like a muscle. Performing small steps that eventually develop into a habit will reap the most benefits.

### The Marshmallow Experiment

Willpower and successful habit performance are tightly coupled. Stanford performed a [Marshallow experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment), where they offered children a choice of a small reward immediately in the form of a marshmallow or multiple rewards if they waited for a short period. Only a few children managed to resist the urge of instant gratification and delicious marshmallows.

In the follow-up study on these children, they found that the ones that had better willpower to wait had better success in education and other life outcomes.

### Habit Formation

To consistently perform a habit, it should have three main ingredients. If your habit is going to the gym, it would contain:

- **Cue**. The cue for going to the gym could be preparing the gym equipment in the evening so you are ready to go to a gym in the morning.
- **Routine**. The routing for the gym would be going to the gym.
- **Reward**. The really important thing if you want to keep up with habits is to reward yourself after a successful routine. In our gym example, this could be eating one piece of chocolate.

One trick I learned from watching YouTube videos from Matt D'Avella is to implement a "two-day rule". You shouldn't break the habit for more than **two days in a row** (like going to the gym, meditating, reading a book).

## Gamification and habit formation

TODO: read about role-playing games and gamification, improve this (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification)

To understand the concepts of gamification, it's best to look at the video-game industry. A lot of games have an element of role-playing, where you choose a character and build it over time. You can improve it by managing its health, buying better equipment and performing quests.

These games can be really fun to play and why not take the same character-building concept and apply it to real-life. And the app we are going to take a look at next does just that.

### Habitica

> [Habitica](https://habitica.com) is an opensource video game to help you improve real-life habits. It "gamifies" your life by turning all your tasks (habits, dailies, and to-dos) into little monsters you have to conquer. The better you are at this, the more you progress in the game. If you slip up in life, your character starts backsliding in the game (Habitica.com).

In the app, the main domains are habits, dailies, todos, and rewards:

- **Habits**. You would list the habits you want to establish here. They can be positive or negative and by completing positive habits, you gain in-app gold and experience and lose it by doing the negative habit.

- **Dailies**. These are recurring tasks you do every day, week or month. You have fine-grained controls about when to do these. You lose in-app health by not completing dailies. If you lose too much health you virtually die and lose a level.

- **Todos**. The tasks you do once or rarely. Long term or more complex todos can be broken down with checklists. You gain

- **Rewards**. It's important to reward yourself for the hard work you did. You can buy rewards with in-app earned gold and rewards are ranging from character equipment like swords, hats, etc to custom rewards that you can define.

They have a great [wiki page](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Habitica_Wiki) and you can interact with your character on the go with either [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/habitica-gamified-taskmanager/id994882113) or [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.habitrpg.android.habitica&hl=en).
