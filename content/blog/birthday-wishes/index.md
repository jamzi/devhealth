I continue the streak of creating side projects with a really simple app to help you find birthday wishes for your friends and family.

### Idea

The first idea was an appreciation app. Then I wondered what it was niche and I wondered if I could reach more people with the more general application for sending and generating birthday wishes.

These are not fancy AI blockchain machine learning generated, they are plain old gather and save and display.

### Market research

I often find myself searching for a decent birthday quote to send to my friends or family and I was quite sure I'm not alone.

I fired up the [Google Keywords Planner tool](https://ads.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/) and saw that there is quite a demand for this.

I found some competition, similar websites, but they were either slow, not the best looking or both.

### Implementation

Since I've been doing a lot of side projects, I wanted to create a common way to scaffold a new project. I usually use pretty much the same tech stack, because I can quickly develop a new project without worrying about the tools I am using.

I created a [boilerplate project on GitHub](https://github.com/jamzi/nextjs-boilerplate). It is based on the NextJS framework using Typescript. It also comes bundled in with Google Analytics and Sentry error reporting tool. Feel free to check it out and use it in your own projects.

### User testing

I have no problems building things and solving technical challenges. But when it comes to design, user experience and solving a user's problem, I have a lot to learn.

This is why I started learning about this stuff as well with this project.

> I found a great article describing a case study of fellow Slovenian designers redesigning one of the most visited websites in Slovenia. It talks about user flows, user personas, usability testing, etc. Check it out [here](https://klemenselakovic.com/partis-klemen-selakovic)

I also installed a plugin called Hotjar, which can help you see what people are doing on your website. You can see which elements are they clicking or you can even record their session. This combined with Google Analytics should provide me some data on how people are using my app.

### Launch

I wanted to do a lot of user testing before launching this app.

I posted an MVP version after a weekend of coding to the UX and UI Reddit groups. I got a few positive comments on the app and some suggestions on how could I improve and better "guide" the user through the app.

I will launch the app on the usual channels, like social media and product websites like ProductHunt and Indie Hackers.

I noticed it's really important to create good screenshots and preferably an animated short video about your product to intrigue the potential users. I'll also do a check and review on my SEO efforts.

#### SEO

Birthday wishes are something that people are searching on google mostly. I want to rank higher with my website than other websites.

I quickly researched some SEO techniques and I added the classics like modifying the title and header tags to include most searched keywords. The site is also pretty fast because we are using the latest server-side rendering framework and this should help it rank higher in Google.

I also edited my meta tags, which means that posting a link to my website on social media will look pretty (with image and everything). I used a cool tool called HeyMeta (heymeta.com), which lets you check and fix your meta tags in the head of the website.

### Overview

Currently, I just want to provide value with my app and help people find cool and unique birthday wishes.

If I provide enough value, people will come and we can later think about monetization options. These could be connecting with buying gifts, providing personalization options to birthday wishes or similar. If the page receives a lot of traffic, putting a reasonable amount of ads could be a possibility as well.
