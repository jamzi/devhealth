Dan Buettner in his book [The Blue Zones: Lessons for Living Longer From the People Who've Lived the Longest](https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Zones-Lessons-Living-Longest/dp/1426207557) explores 5 places in the world where people live the longest and calls these locations blue zones.

Buettner travels to each of the blue zones and interviews centenarians (individuals who reached the age of 100). Many of these elders still live independently and he notices a few common traits that play a role in living longer:

- **Food**. Simple, predominantly plant-based food, which is rich in nutrients.
- **Physical activity**. Many of these people have their gardens or work long hours on the field.
- **Family and purpose**. These communities are based around family values. When people reach old years, they still have a role in the family by helping to raise their grandchildren.
- **Sense of community**. People visit each other and support others in time of need.

### Okinawa, Japan

One of the blue zones that especially stands out is the island of Okinawa, Japan. It's located south of the mainland Japan and north-east of Taiwan. It has a nice, humid subtropical climate which is perfect for farming.

This is a place where there are more centenarians than anywhere in the world. There are approximately 50 per 100.000 people in comparison to about 20 per 100.000 in the US (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centenarian).

In the book Blue Zones, Dan talks with the elders in the villages and they talk about a purpose in life called Ikigai.

> The term ikigai compounds two Japanese words: iki (生き) meaning "life" and kai (甲斐) meaning "to be worthwhile". It can be interpreted as "a reason for living", "meaning for life" or as they like to explain it "a reason to get up in the morning"

Ikigai is a unique intersection between what you are good at and what you love. Many centenarians on Okinawa island say that they have a purpose in life like taking care of their family, perfecting a craft or gossiping.

They connect this sense of purpose with being present in the moment and having fun ("Don't worry, be happy" attitude).

This is quite different from most people living in more common societies, where individuals are suffering from different forms of existential crises. We have better living conditions and education than our parents and grandparents, but people still don't what to do in life and often worry too much.

### Finding your Ikigai

Buettner suggests making three lists: your values, things you like to do, and things you are good at. The cross-section of the three lists is your ikigai.

1. **What do I love?**
2. **What am I good at?**
3. **What can I be paid for now — or something that could transform into my future hustle?**
4. **What does the world need?**

What is your Ikigai?

### Additional notes

After World War 2, Okinawa has changed a lot. It currently hosts 32 US military bases and it's influenced a lot by American culture. This has decreased the life span of adults living there now. I intentionally focused on the values and habits of elders living in the villages of Okinawa.
