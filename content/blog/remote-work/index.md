### What is remote work

- You must act like you go to work (put on nice shirt instead of sweatpants) or establish physical separation between living space and working space (rent office, go to a coworking place)
- Two types of remote work (settling down in a place (with friends and family) or being a "digital nomad", travelling to new places often)
- Remote study (6nomads, provide link), said that the average age of remote developers was 30-35 and they had from 5-7 years of relevant experience. That meant that the move to remote work was concious

Have a social life before/after work (discover and schedule social activities)

If you have a family home when you work, talk to them and establish a schedule where you don't want to be bothered (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh4f9AYRCZY)

### Benefits

- More productive remote work (telecommuting) as you minimize distractions (link to distractions post)

* You save time by skipping the commute.

### Drawbacks

- It's sometimes hard to be productive when working remotely, as there are distractions in your house (tv, computer, ps, ...)

* It's hard, not that social (human component) and you need to be smart to not overwork (you need to be disciplined, have hard boundaries when to stop working) and burnout (link to burnout)

Working by the pool image funny :D

### Communication

- Be transparent with communication and document everything

  Virtual coffee breaks over the conference call.

* Overcommunicate, if you are a lead and have remote workers, appreciate and ephasise that they are doing a good job

Contact Fatih Acet (GitLab and ask about remote work ()

- QUestions;
  -- What do you think is the biggest benefit of working remotely?
  -- What are some issues you faced when working remotely?
  -- Remote-only or partly-remote company?
  -- If you have faced loneliness and lack of social contact, how did you overcome it

- allow bursty communication (align a period of time where there is back and forth communication, syncronous)

### Tools

- Video meeting tools are essential, as they improve communication with non-verbal cues.

### Remote-first companies

- It's easier to be in a fully remote company instead of the solely remote worker

- Ask current employer if you can remote work (full or just a few days)

Companies that embrace remote culture: Automaticc (The company behind Wordpress), GitLab, Buffer, Trello...

- Large companies like Stripe opening remote "hubs".

- Participation in open source projects can simulate working in a remote team

### Conclusion

Over communicating is always better than making assumptions. (Quote from Trello book)

- It's the future of working, those who work say the benefits of remote work outperform the negatives. There are smart people everywhere in the world and it makes sense for companies as they get larger pool of candidates.
