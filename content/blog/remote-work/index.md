description: TODO (Skip the commute, pants optional)
---

- More productive remote work (telecommuting) as you minimize distractions (link to distractions post)
- It's sometimes hard to be productive when working remotely, as there are distractions in your house (tv, computer, ps, ...)
- You must act like you go to work (put on nice shirt instead of sweatpants) or establish physical separation between living space and working space (rent office, go to a coworking place)
- It's the future of working, those who work say the benefits of remote work outperform the negatives. There are smart people everywhere in the world and it makes sense for companies as they get larger pool of candidates.
- You save time by skipping the commute.
- Large companies like Stripe opening remote "hubs".
- It's hard, not that social (human component) and you need to be smart to not overwork (you need to be disciplined, have hard boundaries when to stop working) and burnout (link to burnout)
- Ask current employer if you can remote work (full or just a few days)
- Overcommunicate, if you are a lead and have remote workers, appreciate and ephasise that they are doing a good job
- It's easier to be in a fully remote company instead of the solely remote worker
- Be transparent with communication and document everything
- Two types of remote work (settling down in a place (with friends and family) or being a "digital nomad", travelling to new places often)
- Remote study (6nomads, provide link), said that the average age of remote developers was 30-35 and they had from 5-7 years of relevant experience. That meant that the move to remote work was concious
- Participation in open source projects can simulate working in a remote team

Working by the pool image funny :D
Have a social life before/after work (discover and schedule social activities)
If you have a family home when you work, talk to them and establish a schedule where you don't want to be bothered (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh4f9AYRCZY)

Automaticc (distributed first)

Virtual coffee breaks over the conference call.
